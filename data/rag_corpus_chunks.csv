C05206,DOC0700,mlops_docs,0,110,"A mature MLOps practice treats machine learning systems like any other production software service. Teams track experiments, register models with clear versioning, and separate training pipelines from online serving infrastructure. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to move from a prototype notebook to a robust, observable service that can be deployed and rolled back safely."
C05207,DOC0700,mlops_docs,1,110,"Monitoring in MLOps covers far more than simple latency and error rates. Product teams inspect input feature distributions for data drift, track prediction histograms over time, and compare live performance against a frozen validation set.
